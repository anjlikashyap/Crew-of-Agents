To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Install Required Libraries
Install the required libraries using pip:

Copy code
pip install crewai flask flask_restful flask_cors PyPDF2 pytesseract pillow flask_mail flask_httpauth
2. Set up CrewAI Framework
Set up the CrewAI framework using the provided documentation and tutorials.

3. Configure Email Settings
Configure the email settings in app.config. You'll need to provide your email server details, such as the SMTP server, username, and password.

4. Run the API
Run the API using:


Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
python app.py
This will start the Flask development server, and the API will be available at http://localhost:5000.

5. Send a POST Request
Send a POST request to the /api/report endpoint with the blood test report PDF file and user's email address. You can use a tool like Postman or cURL to send the request.

Example using cURL:

bash

Copy code
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:5000/api/report \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/pdf' \
  -T blood_test_report.pdf \
  -d 'email=user@example.com'
Replace blood_test_report.pdf with the actual file name and path, and user@example.com with the actual email address.

6. Verify the Response
Verify that the API responds with a JSON message indicating that the report has been processed and an email has been sent successfully.

7. Check the Email
Check the user's email inbox for the personalized health recommendations and articles.

Note: This is a high-level implementation, and you may need to modify the code to fit your specific requirements. Additionally, you'll need to implement the logic for parsing the extracted text, searching for health-related articles, and sending the email.
